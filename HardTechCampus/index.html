                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>Hard Tech Campus is an organization focused on the development of sustainability projects into products. Most importantly, we are focused on projects that utilize technological advancements in either hardware or software to achieve one
                    of the following target areas, with respect to the given <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">UN Sustainability Goals:</a>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Industrial change (Goals 12 and 9)</li>
                    <li>- Health, hunger, clean water, sanitation (Goals 2, 3, and 6)</li>
                    <li>- Products for consumers (Goals 7 and 11)</li>
                    <li>- Environmental clean-up (Goals 14 and 15)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Last year, we ran a 10 week summer program where we focused on helping engineering teams build startup companies. However, we realized that this was too rigid of a form and forced more people into entrepreneurship that did not want to
                    go that direction.</p>
                <h3 class="important">If you would like to be a part of Hard Tech Fund, please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/ExFWNFBKwEe9AG9f6">Google Application</a>!</h3>

                <h2>Our plan for this year</h2>
                <p>This year, we are running monthly sprints to help teams:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Find team members</li>
                    <li>- Gain mentorship from students who have built engineering projects and/or are EME50 certified and can use shop equipments</li>
                    <li>- Keep teams on track</li>
                    <li>- Present teams with opportunities to pitch in front of seed investors, government organizations, potential business clients, and other potential customers</li>
                </ul>
