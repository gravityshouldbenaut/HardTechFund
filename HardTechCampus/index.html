          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <p>The Hard Tech Fund is a startup development program founded by Hyperloop at UC Davis, Space and Satellite Club, Blockchain at Davis, Bioinnovation Group at UC Davis, and Quantum Computing at UC Davis. All of these clubs have built or assisted in the construction of hardware that will help decrease emissions, reconstruct supply chains, and change the public perspective on environmental conservation. They wanted a dedicated space for their members and the UC Davis community to build hardware with this mission in mind. This 10 week program during the summer session will provide the time, funding, and workshops necessary to turn these projects into products for future licensing or as the basis of future businesess.</p>

          <h2>What is our program?</h2>
          <p>We run a program that takes a hardware project from ideation to minimum viable product (MVP).</p>

        <h2>Previous Projects</h2>
        <h3>Neutron</h3>
        <section id="neutron" class="textimg">
          <p>Neutron is a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) for electric vehicles (EVs). This HESS has the advantage of fast charging (80 miles in 7 minutes with a 150 kW charger), a longer lifetime and a reduced thermal management system.</p>

        <h3>Plasticoin</h3>
        <p id="plasticoin">PlastiCoin is a blockchain based platform for recycling plastic. It's a cryptocurrency which is rewarded to people who recycle their plastic in smart-bins produced by us. With PlastiCoin, we want to tap into the power of communities to contribute to the recycling of plastic, and put back into use the millions of tonnes of plastic that is thrown away every year. Its our generation that decides whether the Earth at the end of the 21st century becomes a home for a thriving human civilization, or a wasteland full of towers of garbage.</p>

        <h3>Environmental Sensor Project</h3>
        <section id="ndvi" class="textimg">
          <p>The environmental sensor project is a project to build a system that would use a set of infrared cameras and other sensors to create a full sensor suite for understanding atmospheric and environmental changes. It was completed as a project for the Space and Satellite Systems club at UC Davis, an organization manufacturing and launching a cube satelite into low earth orbit.</p>
