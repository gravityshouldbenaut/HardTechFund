            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>The Hard Tech Fund is a startup development program founded by Hyperloop at UC Davis, Space and Satellite Club, Blockchain at Davis, Bioinnovation Group at UC Davis, and Quantum Computing at UC Davis. All of these clubs have built or assisted
                in the construction of hardware that will help decrease emissions, reconstruct supply chains, and change the public perspective on environmental conservation. They wanted a dedicated space for their members and the UC Davis community to
                build hardware with this mission in mind. This 10 week program during the summer session will provide the time, funding, and workshops necessary to turn these projects into products for future licensing or as the basis of future businesess.</p>

            <h2>What is our program?</h2>
            <p>We run a program that takes a hardware project from ideation to minimum viable product (MVP).</p>
