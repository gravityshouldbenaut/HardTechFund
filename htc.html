            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>Hard Tech Campus is an organization focused on the development of sustainability projects into products. Most importantly, we are focused on projects that utilize technological advancements in either hardware or software to achieve one
                of the following target areas, with respect to the given <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank">UN Sustainability Goals:</a>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Industrial change (Goals 12 and 9)</li>
                <li>Health, hunger, clean water, sanitation (Goals 2, 3, and 6)</li>
                <li>Products for consumers (Goals 7 and 11)</li>
                <li>Environmental clean-up (Goals 14 and 15)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Last year, we ran a 10 week summer program where we focused on helping engineering teams build startup companies. However, we realized that this was too rigid of a form and forced more people into entrepreneurship that did not want to
                go that direction.</p>

            <p id="plasticoin">PlastiCoin is a blockchain based platform for recycling plastic. It's a cryptocurrency which is rewarded to people who recycle their plastic in smart-bins produced by us. With PlastiCoin, we want to tap into the power of communities to
                contribute to the recycling of plastic, and put back into use the millions of tonnes of plastic that is thrown away every year. Its our generation that decides whether the Earth at the end of the 21st century becomes a home for a thriving
                human civilization, or a wasteland full of towers of garbage.</p>
