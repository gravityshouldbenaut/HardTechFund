                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>Hard Tech Campus is an organization focused on the development of sustainability projects into products. Most importantly, we are focused on projects that utilize technological advancements in either hardware or software to achieve one
                    of the following target areas, with respect to the given <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">UN Sustainability Goals:</a>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Industrial change (Goals 12 and 9)</li>
                    <li>- Health, hunger, clean water, sanitation (Goals 2, 3, and 6)</li>
                    <li>- Products for consumers (Goals 7 and 11)</li>
                    <li>- Environmental clean-up (Goals 14 and 15)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Last year, we ran a 10 week summer program where we focused on helping engineering teams build startup companies. However, we realized that this was too rigid of a form and forced more people into entrepreneurship that did not want to
                    go that direction.</p>

                <h2>Upcoming Agenda</h2>
                <p>This year, we are running monthly sprints to help teams:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Find team members</li>
                    <li>- Gain mentorship from students who have built engineering projects and/or are EME50 certified and can use shop equipments</li>
                    <li>- Keep teams on track</li>
                    <li>- Present teams with opportunities to pitch in front of seed investors, government organizations, potential business clients, and other potential customers</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2020 Plan</h2>
                <p>Our first monthly sprint starts April 10th, 2020 and goes until May 10th, 2020. However, you can apply at any time, and the sprints start the day you are accepted into the program. We are planning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Weekly team meetings with mentors who have expertise in the area you want to work in</li>
                    <li>2. Bi-weekly meeting with some of the members of the Sustainability Club Coalition, engineering club leads, and Hard Tech Campus mentors to demonstrate progress</li>
                    <li>3. End of monthly sprint meeting with potential clients and customers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We are still looking for speakers for each of these weeks and attendees for demo day. If you would like to speak during our program or attend demo day, email <a href="mailto:kdesh@ucdavis.edu?Subject=Demo%20Day%20Inquiry" target="_top">kdesh@ucdavis.edu</a>.</p>

                <p id="plasticoin">PlastiCoin is a blockchain based platform for recycling plastic. It's a cryptocurrency which is rewarded to people who recycle their plastic in smart-bins produced by us. With PlastiCoin, we want to tap into the power of communities to
                    contribute to the recycling of plastic, and put back into use the millions of tonnes of plastic that is thrown away every year. Its our generation that decides whether the Earth at the end of the 21st century becomes a home for a thriving
                    human civilization, or a wasteland full of towers of garbage.</p>

                    <p>The environmental sensor project is a project to build a system that would use a set of infrared cameras and other sensors to create a full sensor suite for understanding atmospheric and environmental changes. It was completed as a
                        project for the Space and Satellite Systems club at UC Davis, an organization manufacturing and launching a cube satelite into low earth orbit.</p>
